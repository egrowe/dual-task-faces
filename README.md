# dual-task-faces

Dual-task similarity ratings experiment using face stimuli (male and female)
We used a dual-task paradigm to compare performance and perceptual similarity ratings during the central and peripheral single-tasks independently and when both were performed simultaneously. In all blocks, the visual stimuli remained the same, only the task instructions and task-relevance of the stimuli changed.

The peripheral stimulus set consisted of eight female and eight male faces that were matched on age, luminance, facial expression and race. Overall, there were 64 possible face pairs (with no exact same pairs being shown – see faces_StimulusMatrix_Pairings.png for possible pairings)

In each trial, two of these faces (either male/male, female/female or different genders) were randomly selected and presented in one of two diametrically opposing positions in the periphery of the screen (i.e. top left and bottom right or bottom left and top right). The faces took up 2.5o visual angle. The two possible locations that the faces could appear was at the corners of an imaginary 8o x 10o rectangle around the centre of the screen. After a short temporal delay each of the faces was replaced with randomly selected ‘face scramble’ that consisted of a 4 x 4 grid of randomly selected segments of alternative male or female face images. The time delay between the stimulus pairs and the mask was determined via the QUEST (Quick Estimate of Threshold, Watson & Pelli, 1983) staircase procedure.

This QUEST staircase procedure was used to determine the stimulus-onset-asynchronies (SOAs) for central and peripheral targets and masks. These SOAs remained stationary during the peripheral single-task and the dual-task. Using the QUEST staircase procedure, we were able to reduce training time by robustly adjusting the SOAs in a trial-by-trial manner for the central and peripheral (SOA setup) single-tasks according to each participant’s abilities (set at 70% accuracy in both of the single-tasks). These were adjusted in the peripheral ‘match vs no match’ single-task block and in the central single-task block.
